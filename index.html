            Hello! I'm Prabesh Mallathakuri, a passionate individual with a love for coding and technology. Currently pursuing Computer Science at East Central University.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey in the world of technology started when I was 10 years old and I was fascinated  by how a computer operates and  my interest grew from there and explored everything I saw as much as I could.Since then, I've been exploring various programming languages and frameworks, constantly learning and challenging myself to become a better developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to coding, I have a keen interest in sports. I love watching soccer especially the English Premier League and I am an Arsenal fan.I believe in continuous learning, and I'm always looking for new opportunities and challenges to growboth personally and professionally.
